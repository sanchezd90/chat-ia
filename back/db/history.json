This method is available on the event object itself and can be called within an event listener to stop the default action from occurring.\n\nHere is an example to demonstrate preventing the default behavior of a button click event:\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n  // Prevent the default behavior of the click event\n  event.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n\nIn the above example, when a click event occurs anywhere on the document, the event listener will prevent the default behavior of the click (which normally follows through with the page refresh or link navigation).\n\nIt's important to note that preventing the default behavior of an event will also prevent any other event listeners further down in the event chain from executing. This can be useful for preventing unwanted actions or for ensuring that certain actions take precedence over others.\n\nBy utilizing the preventDefault() method, you have the ability to control the behavior of JavaScript events and customize their functionality according to your specific requirements."},{"client":"How can I implement Bulma in a react app?","server":" Implementing Bulma in a React app is a straightforward process.
